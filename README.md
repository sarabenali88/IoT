This projects belongs to Sara Benali.

## Getting Started

This project contains a setup using Docker. This will help you setup all the necessary tools to start developing your IoT project.
Before you run the docker-compose command, make sure you have to make changes to the configuration. You can find these in
the `.env` file.

Now, to install and start your project; run the following command in the root of your project:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

If everything runs correctly, you should be able to visit your website at [http://localhost/](http://localhost/).

## Structure

There is a specific structure that you should follow when developing your project. This will help you to keep your project organized and easy to understand.

```
