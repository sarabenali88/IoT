# Create & Test

## Digital Manufacturing

### Device and Material

The device I have used to create my design is the laser cutter. The reason why I chose to use the laser cutter is because
I wanted to work with wood. I used the laser cutter in the makers-lab. The type of wood I have chosen to work with is 
4mm MDF. I first made a design on the makers-case website and the measurements I used in there are: 
Width: 180 mm
Height: 80 mm
Depth: 101.6 mm
Finger size: 39
Material thickness: 4mm
LCD-screen: 72 mm * 24 mm 
Push button: 12.5 mm * 12.5 mm
LED: 4 mm * 4 mm
LDR: 5 mm * 5 mm

### First prototype

For the first prototype I used the speed/power 20.0/65.0. I used the material MDF with a measurement of 4mm
and everything went well. Though I did find out one week after that I entered the wrong material in de software program.
I entered wood (as I was told to enter)but I was actually using MDF. Even though I did enter the wrong material,
the design came out good. There were no burn marks or whatsoever. The only thing that wasn't accurate was the measurements
for my design.

### Second prototype
For the second prototype I used another material. This time I used plywood with a thickness of 4mm and with the same
speed/power 20.0/65.0. This time things didn't go all too well, because after the laser was done with cutting,
I saw some black spots on the back of my design. I think the power was too high for the plywood. I also didn't like how
the plywood felt and looked. So I have decided to definitely use the MDF material for my design. Something I also realised
is the new measurements I used, weren't the right measurements either.

### Third prototype
Since we're not "allowed" to use any glue or tape, I wanted to work with fingers in my design. I used multiplex again,
because that's the only test material there was and this time it did look good. I searched on Google for some
websites and I found one where I can laser cut a pyramid with. It didn't go too well. I cut out the first design, only
two sides of the pyramid, with the fingers and when the cutting was done, I saw that the fingers were the exact same. I then
tried some other measurements for the fingers, but it didn't fit again. I ended up with four different sides and none of them
fit with the other. I tried to make a new design in makers case and next time I am going to try to cut that design out.

### Fourth prototype
For the fourth prototype I have changed my design idea. Since the pyramid didn't work with the finger joints and this
design idea in the makers-case wasn't practical. Building it like this didn't make any sense to me, and it didn't look nice
at all:

So I just chose to build a box as my design. I bought some MDF material and I cut out my design three times. The first one
was too small because I changed the measurements in the LIGHTBURN program, but that was my fault. The second and third
came out perfectly, this time I just imported it and didn't change anything. The sides fit perfectly with each other. I 
cut out the design twice, because on one I want to cut out some shapes to check which measurements I need for the device 
materials. Unfortunately, I didn't take a picture of the box before I took the box apart. 
Below is a picture of the design I cut:

### Fifth prototype
For the fifth prototype I cut out the last things for my design. I cut out some shapes for the push button, LED and LDR,
so I know exactly which measurements I need. I found the measurements and I put them in the top of this file under the 
heading device and materials. I think I am finished with the design now. I will add a picture later of how the box looks
like after putting the sides together:
