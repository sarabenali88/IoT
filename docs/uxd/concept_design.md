# Concept & Design

### User needs
As a user you can make your appointments on the website, and you will receive a reminder for your appointment. As a user 
you will get notified by a sound, when it's time for the user's appointment, the smart device will make a buzzer sound. 
The smart device will also have a button, so you can turn off the sound. As a user you can also see the name of your 
appointment displayed on the smart device. The device will be made in a way that the user can place it anywhere they want.

### Main goal
So in short, the main goal of this device is to make it easier for a user to follow their appointments without having
the need to keep checking on which day the appointment is and what time the appointment takes place.

### Requirements
To meet the user needs, these are the requirements I have set up for the smart device:
- The device will be using with an LCD-display. By using the LCD-display the appointment name can be display on the device 
for the user. This is easy because you can immediately read what your appointment is. 
- The device will have an active buzzer. This buzzer will go off at least one hour before the appointment so the user 
will have enough notice to prepare for the appointment. 
- The user will be provided with a website. A simple website will be provided so the user can enter the date, time and 
appointment name. 
- The device will a push button. With this push button the user can turn the buzzer off. This is because it wouldn't be nice 
for the user to have a sound keep going off for one hour for example. 
- One requirement I want to try to make work is that the moment the user turns off the buzzer, the next appointment will 
be displayed on the LCD-display screen. 

### Design
I have chosen to design a pyramid as the smart device. I think a pyramid is simple, easy to look at and doesn't require
lots of functionalities to actually understand the device. The pyramid will have 4 sides and will look like a 3d pyramid. 
This is because I can place different technical materials on different sides. The LCD-display screen will be placed on 
the front of the pyramid. The push button to turn the buzzer off, will be placed on the right side of the pyramid. Below
I have some starter designs for the pyramid I want to build:

Here I have made an origami pyramid. It doesn't look very nice because I made it from paper. But it does resemble the 
design I want to have for my smart device.
