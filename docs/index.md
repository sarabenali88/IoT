# Calender

The blue-print Calendar will be used as a reminder for the appointments of a user. The user will enter their
appointments in the calendar on the website. Everytime when there is an appointment, the clock will make a sound, and
you will see the appointment name displayed. The design I have chosen for this project is a pyramid. I will use wood to 
build a pyramid and put an LCD-display inside, so you can see the name of the appointment. When it's time a sound will be
heard and you can turn off the sound if you click on a button.
