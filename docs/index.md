# Calender

The blue print Calender will be used as a reminder for the appointments of a user. The user will enter their
appointments in the calender on the website. Everytime when they're is an appointment, the clock will make a sound and
something will pop out of the clock as a reminder that a user has an appointment. The design I have chosen for this 
project is a whale. I will use wood to build a whale and put a digital clock inside it that will show the time and name
of the appointment. When it's time a sound will be heard and something will pop out of the hole of the whale.
