# System Architecture

On this page you can describe the system architecture of your full-project. This includes the architecture of the software, the hardware and the communication between them. Make sure you create a clear overview, don't forget everything that is included in the existing Docker environment.

Keep your system architecture up-to-date during the project. It is a living document that should reflect the current state of your project.
