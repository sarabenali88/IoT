# System Architecture
I have started working on the web-application for this project. On this website the user can enter their appointments. 
The user sees the form where they can enter the date, time and appointment name after the user clicks on "Add appointment"
, the appointment will be added to the list of appointments. The sole reason for this website is for the user to end up 
receiving reminders for their appointments. 

I have started working on the front-end and I can say that it is almost finished. I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I used HTML to create the view of the website. I used input fields to create a datepicker, time-picker and an open text
field. In this view I have used bootstrap for spacing, padding, colors and to put everything in the right rows and columns. 
Lastly I added validation for the fields with JavaScript. I used the value of the fields and did a check with if-statements
to check if the field is empty or not. If it is, an errormessage will be displayed on the website.
