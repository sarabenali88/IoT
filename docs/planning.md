# Planning

## 9-02-2024
In week 2 I want to work on different things every class. Upcoming monday I want to start building my design. I want to
build the design idea I created, so I have something to work with for now. I plan on using wood to build my design.
On Wednesday I want to work on the embedded part. I want to make sure I understand what I am supposed to do with 
everything I have in my box. I want to try to make something work like a sound or make sure you can see the time on the 
segment display. On thursday I want to work on my website and on that day I want to finish the design I have for now 
so I have a website I can use to connect with smart device. On friday I want to do more research on how to be able to 
connect things I have in the kit to my website because I want to find out how I am supposed to transfer the data I get 
from my website to my smart device.
