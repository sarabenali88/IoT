# Planning

## 9-02-2024
- Monday:
  \On Monday I am going to work on my design. I am going to sketch out how I want my design to look, calculate the 
measurements to see how big I want my smart device to look like. I also want to sketch out where I want to put all my 
materials. 
- Wednesday:
\On Wednesday I want to work with embedded. This means that I will try to make at least one thing work at the end of the day. 
For example, I want to make sure that a button works when I click on it. 
- Thursday:
\On Thursday I am going to work on the design of my website. At the end of the day I want to have at least finished the design 
so the week after that I can work on the functionalities of the website.
- Friday:
\On Friday I want to work on my planning for week 3. I also want to do more research on how I can make a new thing work. 
So for example, I will do more research on how to make the LCD-display work.
