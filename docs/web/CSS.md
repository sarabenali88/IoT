In this file I will be explaining the styling I did with CSS. 

I did some styling for the button I have in the HTML file. I am using bootstrap, but I didn't like any of the button
colours from bootstrap, so I basically overrode them by adding a background colour and a border color to the button.
The colour I added was a kind of like light beige: 
```
.btn {
    background-color: #edc9af;
    border-color: #edc9af;
}
```

In the next part, I added some styling for hovering over the button. To do this I added the :hover and I added a
background colour of white and a border colour of black:
```
.btn:hover {
    background-color: #f3f3f3;
    border-color: #000000;
}
```
