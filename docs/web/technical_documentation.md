## Web design

Before I started working on my website, I decided to make a prototype of how I wanted the website to look. My initial 
thought was, that I wanted to keep my website as simple as possible. Below you'll find a link to the figma file:

But after this I didn't really like the colours and the way it looked on the page, so I changed the page a little. The 
page ended up looking pretty empty and didn't have any colours. It just didn't look like a typical website, but it did
have the functionalities. You could create an appointment, see all the appointments and delete them too. Below you'll 
find a picture of how it looked like:

I did my research about websites and I wanted to know how I could improve the user interface for people with no IT-background.
I let four users test out my website and received feedback from them. They said the website looked pretty empty and 
there were no colours at all. It just needed a little more decoration, because it didn't look like a typical website 
you would see every day. I wanted the website to have some colours and look fun, but to also have a professional look 
to it. So, I searched for some "professional" colours and I found the colour taupe. I really liked the colour taupe, 
so I implemented this in my website. I used it for my header and for the colour of my buttons.

During the testing I also noticed that the users had to look carefully in the left corner of the page, because the form 
was very small, so I decided to bring it more to the middle of the page and to make the input fields longer. Something 
I also noticed was that the more appointments were made, the longer the page got, so I decided to add a scroll bar to 
the list of cards, that way it's easy to see all the appointments without the page having to be very long. 

The main focus of the website, is that you can create appointments, see them and delete them. So I didn't find it 
necessary to make a homepage for example. I also explained the use of this website in a fun way in the header itself.
Below you'll find a picture of how the website looks like now:

The software I used for my website is Intellij, MySqlWorkbench, and the docker environment. In the beginning of the project
I did consider using Visual studio code, but I thought that wouldn't be necessary because I could do the exact same thing 
in Intellij, also because I know how Intellij works. I also thought that instead of using PHP, I could create a kind of 
like OOP framework, because I didn't know how to use PHP. But I thought it would be better to use PHP, because then I'd
get to also learn a new programming language.
