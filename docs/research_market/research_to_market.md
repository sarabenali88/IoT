## Research question

For the research market I will be researching about User Interaction. I want to find out how I can make it easier for 
non-it people to  use my website and device. My research question is:
- "What user interface elements can be added to optimize the user interaction for people with 
no IT-background?"
For this research question I have also added two sub questions:
- What are some common examples of user interface problems?
- What are the consequences of user interface problems on website performance?
- What are the experiences of different users while interacting with bad interface?


## Introduction 

Do you struggle a lot to remember to attend all of your appointments while being busy with other things? You're not alone if you're one of the numerous busy 
people who experiences this issue on a daily basis. For this reason, I've created an easy-to-use website and digital 
calendar that are supposed to make appointment scheduling easier for individuals with busy schedules. 

Those that have a busy lifestyle and require a productive approach to schedule their appointments without having to deal with complicated 
technologies are part of my target group. My device is designed to make your daily routine more efficient. This device
is not something too small or too big, so you can place it anywhere you would like, for example your nightstand, on a 
desk or on a side table. 

This is how it works: On the website, you enter the date, time and name of the appointment, 
you save the appointment, and the appointment is now synced with the device. The appointment name will be seen on the 
device and approximately 30 minutes before the appointment, a buzzer will go off to remind you off the appointment. 
By clicking on the button you can turn the buzzer sound off. 

## Research Method 

For this research I have decided when I am going to <em>collect</em> the data, I will be collecting secondary data. I will do online research for my research 
question. This involves searching for different types of articles, reports and scientific articles that talk about the 
improvement in user interaction for non-IT people.

I will be analyzing data in search for <em>qualitative data</em>. This
is because I want to improve my own project idea. I will be looking for common issues, recurring themes and ways to improve my device. 
I want to search and ask for the experiences of a couple of people on how difficult it is to sometimes use IT-related tools 
and what would help them to improve their user experience. I will also take a look at what users say online. 

I will be conducting <em>descriptive research</em> and I hope I can get the answer to my research question by using these research 
methods. 
## Results 
*What are some common examples of user interface problems?*

When working with IT-related tools, there are several problems people face with the user interface. Common problems people
experience are: 

- Complex Navigation: Not knowing where to go or where to click next makes the user feel like they're lost. Lots of times 
when users get too frustrated with the complex navigation, they tend the abandon the website completely.

- Inconsistency in layout: When people see to many colours at once, different fonts or button styling, it disrupts the
user experience. It hinders the users by not having any focus while using the website or not being able to read everything 
clearly. 

- Slow pages: People always expect for a page to immediately load when they're interacting with the website. So, when a
page takes forever to load, they get frustrated and this will lead to increase in bounce rates. 

- Vague error messages: Validation is something that has to be added to a website if you want people to enter the right 
things for example. Though the error messages need to be clear, otherwise it could make the user feel helpless. When you 
display an error message that doesn't quite explain what the problem is, it will make it harder for the user to use the 
website.

- Disorganized content: Seeing to many things at once, makes the user feel like they don't know where to look or where 
to start. 

These are not the only problems people face when interacting with a website. More occurring problems are poor readability,
poor accessibility, complex forms and a lot more. [1] [2] 

*What are the consequences of user interface problems on website performance?* 

When the user does not feel satisfied with how everything went while interacting with the website, it often means that 
there are issues with the user interface. User satisfaction is one of the key metrics in knowing how effective the website
is. So, when users encounter frustration, confusion or difficulties it could impact their user experience. But what are 
the consequences when this happens? 

- Decrease user engagement: I already talked a little about how certain user interface problems make users feel. When the 
user experiences any frustration or become disengaged, they tend to abandon the website completely which leads to no user 
engagement and reduced revenue potential. 

- Bad reviews: In today's world, users who experience bad interface will share their frustration with other people. Wether 
it is online or face-to-face. Negative reviews will lead to a loss of potential customers, because people tend to trust 
the opinions of people around them. When this happens, it will take a lot for the company to gain its users trust again. 

- Low conversion rates: Because a badly designed experience can result in lower conversion rates and lower income, user
experience (UX) is essential for directing users through the conversion funnel. When users are not experiencing a good user 
interface, they will abandon the app before they can explore all the features that the website provides.
