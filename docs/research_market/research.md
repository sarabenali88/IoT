## Research question

For the research market I will be researching about User Interaction. I want to find out how I can make it easier for 
non-it people to  use my website and device. My research question is: - "What design and feature elements can be added to
optimize the user interaction for people with no IT-background?"

## Introduction 

Do you struggle a lot to remember to attend all of your appointments while being busy with other things? You're not alone if you're one of the numerous busy 
people who experiences this issue on a daily basis. For this reason, I've created an easy-to-use website and digital 
calendar that are supposed to make appointment scheduling easier for individuals with busy schedules. 

Those that have a busy lifestyle and require a productive approach to schedule their appointments without having to deal with complicated 
technologies are part of my target group. My device is designed to make your daily routine more efficient. This device
is not something too small or too big, so you can place it anywhere you would like, for example your nightstand, on a 
desk or on a side table. 

This is how it works: On the website, you enter the date, time and name of the appointment, 
you save the appointment, and the appointment is now synced with the device. The appointment name will be seen on the 
device and approximately 60 minutes before the appointment, a buzzer will go off to remind you off the appointment. 
By clicking on the button you can turn the buzzer sound off. 

## Research Method 

For this research I have decided when I am going to <em>collect</em> the data, I will be collecting secondary data. I will do online research for my research 
question. This involves searching for different types of articles, reports and scientific articles that talk about the 
improvement in user interaction for non-IT people.

I will be analyzing data in search for <em>qualitative data</em>. This
is because I want to improve my own project idea. I will be looking for common issues, recurring themes and ways to improve my device. 
I want to search and ask for the experiences of different users on how difficult it is to sometimes use IT-related tools 
and what would help them to improve their user experience. I will also need the opinions from different users. 

I will be conducting <em>descriptive research</em> and I hope I can get the answer to my research question by using these research 
methods.
