# Learning journal

Your learning journal can be seen as a diary of your learning process. It is a place where you can reflect on your learning, and where you can keep track of your progress. It is also a place where you can keep track of your questions, and where you can write down your answers to those questions.

So for example when you receive feedback on your project, you can write down the feedback and your reflection on it in your learning journal. You can also write down what you have learned from the feedback, and how you will apply it in your project.
