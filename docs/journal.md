# Learning journal

### 2024-02-08
Today I will continue working on my project. I will sketch out my design and ask for feedback, so I can improve my design. 
For now, I cannot continue working on my web-application because I have no idea where to start and what kind of setup I need.
Today I will try to find that out. 


Your learning journal can be seen as a diary of your learning process. It is a place where you can reflect on your 
learning, and where you can keep track of your progress. It is also a place where you can keep track of 
your questions, and where you can write down your answers to those questions.

So for example when you receive feedback on your project, you can write down the feedback and your reflection on it 
in your learning journal. You can also write down what you have learned from the feedback, and how you will apply it 
in your project.
